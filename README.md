# Logistic-Regression-From-Scratch-R

## Task

Writting a logistic regression algorithm in R using the sigmoid function from scratch, which prints coefficients and accuracy metrics.

## The Steps of Logistic Regression From Scratch

1. Read the data
2. Divide the data into training and test data
3. Determine the number of iteration n
4. Train the model using the training dataset
5. Make predictions using the test dataset
6. Test the model
